# Coding Mystery Box
I was inspired by my wife's habit of buying mystery boxes for her crafts, which she would then come up with projects to use. I wanted something similar for coding projects, so I built this app to give me random ideas. 

## AI Disclosure
I did all the coding myself, but I did have AI generate the ideas in `data.json`.
